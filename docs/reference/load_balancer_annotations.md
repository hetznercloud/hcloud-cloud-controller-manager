# Load Balancer Annotations

This page contains all annotations, which can be specified at a Service of type `LoadBalancer` to configure a Hetzner Cloud Load Balancer. Additionally, this includes read-only annotations, which are set by the Cloud Controller Manager.

- Read-only annotations are set by the Cloud Controller Manager.
- Enums are depicted in the `Type` column and possible options are separated via the pipe symbol `|`.

| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/hostname` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the hostname of the Load Balancer. This will be used as ingress address instead of the Load Balancer IP addresses if specified. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-certificates` | `string` | `-` | `No` | A comma separated list of IDs or Names of Certificates assigned to the service. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-cookie-lifetime` | `int` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the lifetime of the HTTP cookie. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-cookie-name` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the cookie name when using  HTTP or HTTPS as protocol. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-managed-certificate-domains` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Contains a comma separated list of the domain names of the managed certificate. All domains are used to create a single managed certificate. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-managed-certificate-name` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Contains the name of the managed certificate to create by the Cloud Controller manager. Ignored if `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-managed-certificate-name` is missing or set to "uploaded". |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-redirect-http` | `bool` | `false` | `No` | Create a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-status-codes` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Is a comma separated list of HTTP status codes which we expect. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/http-sticky-sessions` | `bool` | `false` | `No` | Enables the sticky sessions feature of Hetzner Cloud HTTP Load Balancers. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/id` | `string` | `-` | `Yes` | Is the ID assigned to the Hetzner Cloud Load Balancer by the backend. Deprecated: This annotation is not used. It is reserved for possible future use. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/ipv4` | `string` | `-` | `Yes` | Is the public IPv4 address assigned to the Load Balancer by the backend. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/ipv4-rdns` | `string` | `-` | `Yes` | Is the reverse DNS record assigned to the IPv4 address of the Load Balancer. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/ipv6` | `string` | `-` | `Yes` | Is the public IPv6 address assigned to the Load Balancer by the backend. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/ipv6-disabled` | `bool` | `false` | `No` | Disables the use of IPv6 for the Load Balancer. Set this annotation if you use external-dns. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/ipv6-rdns` | `string` | `-` | `Yes` | Is the reverse DNS record assigned to the IPv6 address of the Load Balancer. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the location where the Load Balancer will be created in. Changing the location to a different value after the load balancer was created has no effect. In order to move a load balancer to a different location it is necessary to delete and re-create it. Note, that this will lead to the load balancer getting new public IPs assigned. Mutually exclusive with LBNetworkZone. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/name` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Is the name of the Load Balancer. The name will be visible in the Hetzner Cloud API console. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/network-zone` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the network zone where the Load Balancer will be created in. Changing the network zone to a different value after the load balancer was created has no effect.  In order to move a load balancer to a different network zone it is necessary to delete and re-create it. Note, that this will lead to the load balancer getting new public IPs assigned. Mutually exclusive with LBLocation. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/node-selector` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Can be set to restrict which Nodes are added as targets to the Load Balancer. It accepts a Kubernetes label selector string, using either the set-based or equality-based formats. If the selector can not be parsed, the targets in the Load Balancer are not updated and an Event is created with the error message. Format: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/private-ipv4` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the IPv4 address to assign to the load balancer in the private network that it's attached to. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/protocol` | `tcp \| http \| https` | `tcp` | `No` | Specifies the protocol of the service. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/subnet-ip-range` | `string` | `-` | `No` | Specifies the subnet IP range to which the load balancer will be attached. The subnet must belong to the network defined in the CCM configuration and must already exist. The value must be in the CIDR notation. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/type` | `string` | `lb11` | `No` | Specifies the type of the Load Balancer. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/use-private-ip` | `bool` | `false` | `No` | Configures the Load Balancer to use the private IP for Load Balancer server targets. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/uses-proxyprotocol` | `bool` | `false` | `No` | Specifies if the Load Balancer services should use the proxy protocol. |
