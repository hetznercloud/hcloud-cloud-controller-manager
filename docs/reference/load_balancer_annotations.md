| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location` | `-` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location` specifies the location where the Load Balancer will be created in. Changing the location to a different value after the load balancer was created has no effect. In order to move a load balancer to a different location it is necessary to delete and re-create it. Note, that this will lead to the load balancer getting new public IPs assigned. Mutually exclusive with LBNetworkZone. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/name` | `-` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/name` is the name of the Load Balancer. The name will be visible in the Hetzner Cloud API console. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/network-zone` | `-` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/network-zone` specifies the network zone where the Load Balancer will be created in. Changing the network zone to a different value after the load balancer was created has no effect.  In order to move a load balancer to a different network zone it is necessary to delete and re-create it. Note, that this will lead to the load balancer getting new public IPs assigned. Mutually exclusive with LBLocation. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/node-selector` | `-` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/node-selector` can be set to restrict which Nodes are added as targets to the Load Balancer. It accepts a Kubernetes label selector string, using either the set-based or equality-based formats. If the selector can not be parsed, the targets in the Load Balancer are not updated and an Event is created with the error message. Format: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/private-ipv4` | `-` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/private-ipv4` specifies the IPv4 address to assign to the load balancer in the private network that it's attached to. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/protocol` | `tcp` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/protocol` specifies the protocol of the service. Possible values: tcp, http, https |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/type` | `lb11` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/type` specifies the type of the Load Balancer. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/use-private-ip` | `false` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/use-private-ip` configures the Load Balancer to use the private IP for Load Balancer server targets. |
| `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/uses-proxyprotocol` | `false` | `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/uses-proxyprotocol` specifies if the Load Balancer services should use the proxy protocol. |
